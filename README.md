Materials for Earth observation data for official statistics workshops 2018

This repository contains workshop code and html files I prepared for the Earth Observation data for official statistics workshop hosted by the United Nations and held in Bangkok, June 2018.

Main presenters: Kerrie Mengersen Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Jacinta Holloway, (QUT), Michael Schmidt, Department of Environment and Science (DES), Michael Smedes (United Nations Statistics Division), Gordon Reichert (Statistics Canada). 

This workshop provides an opportunity for statistical organisations to participate in discussion and training in the use of earth observation (EO) data, in particular satellite imagery, for official statistics and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The first day of the workshop provides an overview of EO and the ways in which it can be used to report on a variety of SDGs. This will include presentations from different country representatives and discussions among participants. The workshop will continue with a course on the use of satellite data for agricultural statistics. This will include presentations, practical demonstrations and hands-on tutorials focusing on data preparation, analysis and presentation. The practical focus of the course will be on crop-type classification but the techniques and tools are more widely applicable. The workshop will conclude with a half-day wrap-up including discussion about moving forward, priorities for participants and ongoing training opportunities. 

Practical Workshop Content: 
Workshop 1: Working with raster data and preparing satellite imagery data for statistical analyses.
Workshop 2: Crop classification part 1: Tree based approaches (Boosted Regression Trees and CART).
Workshop 3: Crop classification part 2 (K-nn and multinomial logistic regression).
Workshop 4: Time series analyses for crop yield (ARMA, ARIMA and State Space Model).
